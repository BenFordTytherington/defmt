error[E0382]: use of moved value: `f.inner`
 --> $DIR/write-twice.rs:6:9
  |
5 |         defmt::write!(f, "hello");
  |         -------------------------- value moved here
6 |         defmt::write!(f, "world");
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `f.inner` has type `&mut InternalFormatter`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
