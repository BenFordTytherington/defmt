error[E0382]: use of moved value: `f.inner`
 --> $DIR/write-for-loop.rs:6:13
  |
6 |             defmt::write!(f, "hello");
  |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value moved here, in previous iteration of loop
  |
  = note: move occurs because `f.inner` has type `&mut InternalFormatter`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider creating a fresh reborrow of `f.inner` here
  |
6 |             &mut *defmt::write!(f, "hello");
  |             ^^^^^^
